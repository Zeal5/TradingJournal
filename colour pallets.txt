If you want to use a color palette that is primarily black and white with a touch of purple, there are a few options you could consider for the tables and widgets showing trades and trade analysis.

One option is to use shades of purple for the tables and widgets to add a pop of color to the overall design. For example, you could use a deep plum or violet color for the tables and a lighter shade of purple,
 such as lavender or periwinkle, for the widgets.

Another option is to use a neutral color, such as a light grey or beige, for the tables and widgets. This will help them blend in with the overall black and white color scheme, 
while still providing a clear visual contrast between the different elements on the page.

If you want to add a little more visual interest, you could also consider using purple as an accent color for select elements, such as headings or buttons. 
This can help draw the eye to important information and give your website a cohesive look.

can you give me hex colors for all the colors you mentioned also tell me background color hex value
Sure! Here are the hex codes for some of the colors I mentioned:

Deep plum: #5D3A6D
Violet: #8B2252
Lavender: #E6E6FA
Periwinkle: #CCCCFF
Light grey: #D3D3D3
Beige: #F5F5DC
As for the background color, it really depends on the overall aesthetic you want to create for your trading journal website. 
A neutral color such as white (#FFFFFF), light grey (#D3D3D3), or beige (#F5F5DC) can work well as a background color, as it will create a clean and uncluttered look that is easy to read.

Alternatively, if you want to create a more dramatic or sophisticated look, you could consider using a darker color such as black (#000000) or a deep purple or plum shade (#5D3A6D or #8B2252). 
Just be mindful that using a darker background color can make text more difficult to read, so you may want to consider using a lighter font color to make the text more legible.
